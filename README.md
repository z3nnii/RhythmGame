# RhythmGame

For my PFDA final, I made a little rhythm game! You'll be putting your hand eye coordination to the test and see if you can get a high score while accurately hitting fast falling notes! You are also accompanied by a little dancing man in the background who's jamming up a storm along with you! 

The files are the audio file for the music, a txt file for the list that is converted into notes, the different poses for the little dance man, and the main file.

Some things I would like to consider for the future are to make animated effects and stylize the game a little more. 

Use ASKL for the keybinds
