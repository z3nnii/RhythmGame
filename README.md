# RhythmGame

For my PFDA final, I made a little rhythm game! You'll be putting your hand eye coordination to the test and see if you can get a high score while accurately hitting fast falling notes! You are also accompanied by a little dancing man in the background who's jamming up a storm along with you! 

Use ASKL for the keybinds
