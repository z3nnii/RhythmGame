PyRhythm

## Repository

## Description
For my PFDA project, I would like to make a rhythm game using pygame and possibly other modules like random for example if needed.

## Features
- Input timings
- Custom Assets
- Maybe Scoring?
- Key inputs
- Rhythm Game maps


## Challenges
- Learn how to make a scoring system with this if I have time
- Learn Github Repo honestly
- Learn workflow and organization of files so no bugs can occur.
- Learn pygame more.


## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A polished interactive audio-reactive art piece thatâ€™s visually impressive and performs well in real-time.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Basic key inputs timings and visable input squares, keystrokes work, note map successfully transfers and works, mp4 works.
