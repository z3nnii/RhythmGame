My Awesome Digital Art Project

## Repository
https://github.com/z3nnii/RhythmGame.git

## Description
This project is an interactive visual experience that reacts to music. It combines real-time audio input with generative art to create a dynamic visual display relevant to digital media.

## Features
- Real-time audio analysis
  - Use Python libraries to detect sound levels and frequency.
- Generative visuals
  - Use Pygame or Processing to create visuals that react to sound input.
- User interaction
  - Add mouse or keyboard input to affect the visuals.

## Challenges
- Learn how to capture and analyze audio in real-time.
- Understand how to connect audio data to visual changes.
- Figure out performance optimizations for smooth real-time rendering.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A polished interactive audio-reactive art piece thatâ€™s visually impressive and performs well in real-time.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A basic app that visualizes sound with simple shapes or colors, even if the visuals are basic or laggy.
